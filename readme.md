A quick simulation of an [autostereogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autostereogram) with [three.js](https://threejs.org/) using multiple views. 


Quoting wikipedia: 

> Stereopsis, or stereo vision, is the visual blending of two similar but not identical images into one, with resulting visual perception of solidity and depth. In the human brain, stereopsis results from complex mechanisms that form a three-dimensional impression by matching each point (or set of points) in one eye's view with the equivalent point (or set of points) in the other eye's view. Using binocular disparity, the brain derives the points' positions in the otherwise inscrutable z-axis (depth). 


Simply cross your eyes as with an typical stereogram and enjoy.
